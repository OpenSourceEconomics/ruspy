    "In this notebook we seek to replicate Iskhakov et al. (2016) with some notable differences in the setup which we will explain in the course of this notebook. To familiarize you with the set up in the paper let us start with a few key points to understand the remainder. Iskhakov et al. (2016) follow up on Su and Judd (2012) in which they had compared the performance of Mathematical Programming with Equlibrium Constraints (MPEC) and the Nested Fixed Point Algorithm (NFXP) for the canonical structural model of bus engine replacement based on Rust (1987). The aim of Iskhakov et al. is mainly to improve the setup of the NFXP of Su and Judd following the explanations of Rust (2000). Their revised comparison between MPEC and NFXP shows that both approaches perform similarly for a Monte Carlo simulation of the bus engine replacement problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "We replicate this Monte Carlo simulation below using our ruspy package in which we have implemented MPEC as well as the NFXP in pure Python. This is gives us the flexibility to easily experiment with key assumptions such as tolerance or optimization algorithms used in one common interface. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the boxes just below we obtain all the key results needed to replicate Table I of Iskhakov et al. For that we got the simulated data by using the original matlab code of the paper to perform the simulation. There they use the setup in which we have 120 time periods and 50 buses. The cost function is assumed to be linear taking the following form $c(x, \\theta_1) = 0.001 \\theta_{11} x$. The true parameters are the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "RC=11.7257,  \\\\\n",
    "\\theta_{11}=2.4569, \\\\\n",
    "\\theta_3=(0.0937, 0.4475, 0.4459, 0.0127, 0.0002).\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The true parameter for $\\beta$ is varied: $\\beta\\in \\{0.975, 0.985, 0.995, 0.999, 0.9995, 0.9999\\}$. For each $\\beta$ 250 data sets are simulated. Those are then estimated using five different starting values for the replacement cost $RC$ and the linear cost parameter $\\theta_{11}$. The following are the five different starting values: \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "(RC^0, \\theta^0_{11}) \\in \\{(4,1), (5,2), (6,3), (7,4), (8,5)\\}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of MPEC also starting values for the discretized expected value function are necessary and they are set to the zero vector every time: $EV^0_1,...,EV^0_{175}=(0,...,0)$. The subscript of 175 also displays the grid size that Iskhakov et al. choose to discretize the continuous variable of mileage. The starting values of the transition probabilities are frequency based in the paper and we follow this approach in our implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "All those ingredients can be found below in the code. Further in our code for the NFXP we specify stopping criteria for the fixed point calculation as well as the tolerance at which we switch from contraction steps to Newton-Kantorovich (N-K) steps. Here, there is a first difference in our implementation of the NFXP as there is no switching back from N-K to contractions teps implemented. Furthermore the switching tolerance is solely an absolute one. For the routine to maximize the likelihood function we rely on the BHHH implementation of estimagic which uses a combination of relative and absolute stopping tolerance which also does not exactly match the original paper. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the MPEC we could not rely on KNITRO as in the paper as it is not freely available. In ruspy it is possible to choose from the library of nlopt or use ipopt for MPEC (please see the References below for links to the respective documentation). For the recreation of the table in Iskhakov et al. we decided to use ipopt here. Again the stopping tolerances cannot exactly be set to those of KNITRO in the paper. Another notable difference is that we only give analytical first order derivatives to ipopt. In the paper, on top of that second order analytical derivatives are provided by using automatic differentiation and also the sparsitiy patterns of both order derivatives are passed in. Apart from that, though, our setup replicates the paper by using upper and lower bounds as well as a properly recentering the expected value function. \n",
    "\n",
    "A last difference in our setup that affects both NFXP and MPEC is that we estimate the transition probabilities separately from the cost parameters. In the original paper for MPEC those are estimated jointly and for the NFXP the cost parameters are first estimated partially and then after that together with the transition probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "For ruspy to run the estimation using either NFXP or MPEC we only need to pass a dictionairy plus the data to the function `estimate(init_dict, data)`. Below we create one dictionairy per approach (NFXP or MPEC) and adapt it accordingly within the nested for-loop below depending on which discount factor $\\beta$ and which starting values are used in the respective run."
