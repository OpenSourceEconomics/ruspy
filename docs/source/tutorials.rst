Tutorials
=========

We provide a `simulation <tutorials/simulation/simulation_convergence.ipynb>`_ and
`replication <tutorials/replication/replication.ipynb>`_ tutorial. The first one
showcases the simulation function of ruspy while the latter has a closer look at the
estimation process. Lastly, for a combination of both you can further dive into the
`replication of Iskhakov et al. (2016)
<tutorials/replication/replication_iskhakov_et_al_2016.ipynb>`_ notebook which allows to
replicate this paper using ruspy. All notebooks can be downloaded from the
tutorials folder of the
`repository <https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/ruspy/blob/master/docs/source/tutorials/>`_.
To execute the notebooks please install ruspy first.
