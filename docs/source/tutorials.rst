Tutorials
=========

We provide a `simulation <notebooks/simulation_convergence.ipynb>`_ and
`replication <notebooks/replication.ipynb>`_. The first one puts more focus on
the simulation function of ruspy while the latter has a closer look at the
estimation process. Lastly, for a combination of both you can further dive into the
`replication of Iskhakov et al. (2016)
<notebooks/replication_iskhakov_et_al_2016.ipynb>`_ notebook which allows to
replicate this paper using ruspy. All notebooks can be downloaded from the
promotion folder of the
`repository <https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/ruspy/blob/master/promotion/>`_.
